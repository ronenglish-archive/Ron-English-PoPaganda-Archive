## Overview

The **Delusionville Genesis Series** marks Ron English’s official collaboration with **Shping**, introducing a set of three digital collectibles themed around Delusionville’s core characters and moral universe. These NFTs served as the gateway to future Shping × Popaganda partnerships, culminating in several later releases and cross-platform utilities.

Each Genesis NFT includes high-resolution animated artwork showcasing Ron English’s signature character types—hybrids, trickster creatures and advertising mutants—rendered in a digital-first format. Collectors who obtained the full trio earned early access rights to subsequent Shping drops.

The Genesis Series is regarded as the formal beginning of the long-term Shping × Ron English partnership, representing the “first step” in a multi-year digital expansion for Delusionville.
