# 2022 – *Delusionville Mix–N–Match Series 1* (Shping × Ron English)

**Year:** 2022 (November 18, 2022)  
**Platform:** Shping  
**Type:** Multi-piece NFT collectible series  

![Delusionville Mix–N–Match — Series 1](../images/Digital/mixnmatch.webp)

## Overview

The **Delusionville Mix–N–Match Series 1** expanded the Shping × Ron English partnership with a character-focused drop structured around **Delusionville’s hybrid, chaotic personalities**. Each NFT features high-resolution artwork centered on a single character and paired with digital lore fragments, encouraging collectors to assemble sets that reveal larger narrative themes.

The series highlights English’s long-standing tradition of fusing species, symbols and pop-cultural motifs into single entities—resulting in an assortment of collectible creatures whose identities shift depending on how collectors combine them.

This drop was especially well-received in the Shping community for its clarity, humor, and the playful “collect them all” format. It also helped establish the cadence of Shping × Ron English releases that continued into 2023.
