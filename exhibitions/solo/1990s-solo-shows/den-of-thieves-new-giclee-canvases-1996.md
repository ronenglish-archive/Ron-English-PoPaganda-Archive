## Overview

Held at the downtown nightclub **Den of Thieves**, this late-night Camel Lights–sponsored event showcased a selection of Ron English’s **new giclée canvases**.  

During the mid-1990s English was actively expanding the use of digital printing technologies in his practice, combining them with hand-painted interventions. This compact solo presentation highlighted that experimental direction while placing English’s work in the center of New York’s nightlife scene—where fashion, advertising and counterculture collided.

The showcard emphasizes the hybrid atmosphere of the event, pairing fine art with a nightclub setting, reflecting English’s tendency to bridge commercial imagery with artistic critique.
