## Overview

Ron English exhibited at Robinson Galleries in Houston under the banner of FotoFest ’90. According to the original gallery show-card, the exhibition opened February 11, 1990; the artist was scheduled to be present for the opening reception. The card identifies Out of the Frying Pan (1989, C-print, 10″ × 8″) as the featured work, indicating that the presentation centered on English’s photographic practice.¹

FotoFest, founded in 1983, is a Houston-based nonprofit and long-running international photography biennial that curates exhibitions and partners with galleries across the city for its International Month of Photography. From its inception, FotoFest has provided a platform for photography and lens-based art, supporting both established and emerging photographers, and offering city-wide exposure for works often beyond traditional fine-art circuits.²

Because no independent digital archive or press review for the 1990 Houston exhibition has surfaced through available resources, the Robinson Galleries show-card remains the primary evidence of this presentation, documenting its date, venue, and medium.¹
