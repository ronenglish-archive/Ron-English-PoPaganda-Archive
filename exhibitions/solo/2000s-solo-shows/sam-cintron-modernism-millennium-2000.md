## Modernism for a New Millennium — Sam Cintron Gallery, Jersey City (January 27 – February 27, 2000)

Ron English’s exhibition **_Modernism for a New Millennium_** was held at the **Sam Cintron Gallery** in Jersey City, New Jersey, from **January 27 to February 27, 2000**. The show card provides the gallery address as **520 Jersey Avenue** and notes an opening reception on **Thursday, January 27, from 6:30–9:30 p.m.**.<sup>1</sup>

Coverage in the *Jersey Journal* by **Karen Mahabir** describes English’s first solo show in Jersey City as featuring “over a dozen oil paintings,” including reinterpretations of American cultural imagery and personalized versions of twentieth-century masterpieces.<sup>2</sup> The article refers to works such as **_Culture Wars_**, a revisionist version of Picasso’s *Guernica* incorporating Disney characters to emphasize English’s anti-advertising themes.<sup>2</sup>

Two images reproduced in the article show English standing before his painting **_English 101_**, and a detail of **_Play It Again, Sam_**, which appeared in the exhibition.<sup>2</sup> The show card additionally lists **_Weeping Women_** (1996, oil on canvas, 66 × 52 in.) as a work associated with the show.<sup>1</sup>
