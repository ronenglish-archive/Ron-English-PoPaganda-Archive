## Overview

Exhibition Overview

Inner City / Outer Limits was a six-artist exhibition at Kenkeleba Gallery on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, presenting recent work by artists whose practices emerged directly from urban street culture. Opening on January 27, 1991 and running through March 3, 1991, the show brought together Andrew Castrucci, Carlos “Waki” Rodriguez, Lee Quinones, Sandra “Pink” Fabara, Ron English, and Martin Wong—all documented together in the gallery’s official press release.¹

According to the press release, the participating artists shared a common perspective shaped by the contemporary inner-city experience, using imagery rooted in graffiti, political critique, narrative realism, and symbolic vocabularies.¹ Quinones and Pink extended New York graffiti into gallery contexts; Wong contributed densely rendered scenes reflecting cultural and emotional life on the Lower East Side; Castrucci and Rodriguez merged mythic and architectural structures; and English employed commercial iconography and political satire to examine American media culture.¹

A companion postcard and contemporary archival listings confirm the exhibition title, date range, and the complete six-artist roster.² ³ The press release also notes that the exhibition was supported by the New York State Council on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, and the Joe and Emily Lowe Foundation.¹ An opening reception took place on January 27, from 3:00 to 7:00 p.m.
