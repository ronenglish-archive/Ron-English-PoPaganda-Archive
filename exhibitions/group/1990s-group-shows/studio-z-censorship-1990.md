## Overview

Censorship was a politically charged group exhibition held at Studio Z in Hoboken, New Jersey, opening on Wednesday, November 28 from 6–9 p.m. The show, organized by Salem Krieger, brought together artists whose work confronted free-speech debates and the cultural tensions surrounding censorship at the end of the 1980s. According to the original Studio Z showcard, participating artists included Karin Batten, Ron English, China Marks, Franc Palaia, Kristen Reed, Salem Krieger, Leslie Sharpe, and Robbie Conal². The exhibition took place at Studio Z’s location at 70 Hudson Street, a venue known for supporting politically engaged and experimental art.

Press coverage at the time highlighted the show’s direct engagement with national controversies. In a contemporary newspaper column on anti-censorship art, writer Keith Sharon reported that Studio Z would feature a photograph by Ron English depicting Uncle Sam scratching his head beneath the caption “Censorship is good because…”¹. Sharon noted that the image was intentionally provocative and aligned with English’s broader satirical investigations of American political symbolism. The same column clarified that although English had additional works in his studio, the photograph was the piece selected for display at Studio Z¹.

Framed within debates about flag burning, NEA funding, and the broader climate of cultural policing, the Censorship exhibition reflected the anxieties and creative resistance of artists responding to the Helms-era moral panic. The participating artists’ works collectively examined how authority attempts to restrict expression, and how art can expose, mock, or defy those pressures. English’s contribution fit squarely within these concerns, adding a visually direct commentary on the paradoxes of censorship and patriotism.
