## Overview

The Helms Degenerate Art Show was a sprawling, multi-venue protest exhibition organized by Ron English and Shawn Eichman in New York in 1989, created in direct response to Senator Jesse Helms, NEA censorship battles, and the new U.S. flag-desecration law. Framing itself after the Nazi “Degenerate Art” exhibition, the project aimed to show exactly what kind of work a censorious culture would try to suppress. More than 300 artists ultimately took part, with studios, galleries, and alternative spaces across the city hosting flag-based works, performances, video, poetry, and political actions.¹

The first installation, a flag show at XFH Multimedia Center on East 12th Street, opened in October 1989 and became a flashpoint when the new flag-desecration law took effect; the owners, unnerved by threats from a self-described neo-Nazi group, ordered the work removed just before the law’s midnight deadline. Much of the material shifted to The World, a Lower East Side nightclub tied to The New Blasphemy Forum at Cooper Union, where English and Eichman helped stage a flag-burning action outside the hall.¹ A later “next installment” opened on December 9, 1989 at Black and White in Color Gallery in the South Bronx (448 East 149th Street), featuring artists such as Ron English, Faith Ringgold, Leon Golub, Nancy Spero, Dread Scott, Richard Serra, Lady Pink, Christo, and Joe Coleman, among many others.² Promotional flyers for the project describe open studios, a “graffiti walk,” and continuous programming of film, music, performance, and visual art under the banner “Helms Degenerate Art Show,” endorsed by anti-censorship and free-expression groups.³
