# 2016 – *Trumpty Dumpty*  
**Bushwick, Brooklyn — Troutman Street**

**Year:** 2016  
**Location:** Troutman Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York, US  

Painted during the opening months of the Trump presidency, Ron English’s **\*Trumpty Dumpty\*** rapidly became one of his most widely circulated political murals. English reimagined the Humpty Dumpty nursery rhyme as a satire of American politics: a Trump-like figure perched precariously on a cracked wall.  

Documentation from March 2017 shows the mural’s placement along **Troutman Street**, a corridor long associated with large-scale political walls and international street artists. The work appeared in global street-art roundups from the U.S. to Australia, cementing its position as a defining political mural of the year.
