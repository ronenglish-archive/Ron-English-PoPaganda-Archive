**Painting the Berlin Wall: A Near-Miss with History**


I had a show in Amsterdam in 1988. Since I was pretty much next door to the Berlin Wall and had two weeks to spare, I decided to head to Berlin and paint it. The Museum at Checkpoint Charlie provided me with paint and a ladder. Before I began, the museum director had me watch a documentary showing a man who had been protesting on top of the wall until the East German authorities pulled him down. He hadn’t been seen since.

The director explained that the wall stood fifteen feet inside East Germany, and if they captured me, no one could help. He told me that if I stood back fifteen feet, I would be safe from the guards. They could only fire their rifles crossways, not directly into West Berlin. He also warned me that they would likely try to sneak up on me to catch me.

He was right. Over the week and a half I worked on the wall, they made several attempts. When I paint, I tend to block out everything around me, which left me exposed. They probably would have captured me if not for a group of escaped East German dissidents who kept a 24-hour vigil at Checkpoint Charlie. They volunteered as lookouts.

I started painting without a design—just my heart logo about forty feet from the opening at Checkpoint Charlie—and worked my way closer every day. The imagery developed through conversations with people visiting the wall. On the last day, I painted some of my creatures reacting to the East German police standing at the entrance. A local paper photographed me with the mural and printed it the next day. I bought ten copies and later returned to look at the wall with an American friend.

He wanted me to cross to the East German side with him, but I was afraid they’d recognize me from the mural, so I declined. After a while he convinced me. We stood in a long tourist line, handing over our passports one at a time. The guard took them into a back room. A few minutes later, several police officers came out, grabbed us, separated us, and placed me in a small room. They confiscated my stack of newspapers and left me alone to reflect on my questionable judgment.

Different policemen came in to interrogate me. All they wanted to know was why I had so many newspapers. I didn’t want to admit I was in them, so I told them they were for friends back home. After a few hours, they expelled me from the country for attempting to spread propaganda. I guess it never occurred to them to open the newspaper and take a look.

Two years later, I returned to Berlin on my honeymoon. The portion of the wall I had painted was completely gone. But so were the guards. And I finally walked through East Berlin.
