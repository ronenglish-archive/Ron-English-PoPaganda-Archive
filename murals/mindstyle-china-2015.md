This mural features Ron English’s iconic **MC Supersized** and **Grin** characters, painted inside the **MINDstyle / Pop Life Global** headquarters in China. English partnered extensively with MINDstyle during this period, creating figures, packaging art and large-scale mural installations throughout their Asian facilities. The Nov 23, 2015 post documenting this wall is part of that long-running collaboration.
