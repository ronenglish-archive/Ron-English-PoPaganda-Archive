# 2015 – “Grinnin’ McB” (Coney Art Walls)  
**Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, US**

**Year:** 2015  
**Location:** Coney Art Walls, Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, US  

For the inaugural season of **Coney Art Walls**, curated by Jeffrey Deitch, Ron English contributed a full-wall **“Grinnin’ McB”** mural that quickly became one of the project’s most recognizable works. The piece fuses fast-food mascots and skeletal grins into a loud, carnival-scale image that fits Coney Island’s history of spectacle. Photo sets from Time Out, Flickr and Brooklyn Street Art highlight how the wall emerged as a standout backdrop for visitors and a key visual in the effort to revive Coney Island’s public-art profile.
