# 2022 – *Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals* (Deep ElIum, Dallas)

**Year:** November 2022  
**Location:** Deep Ellum, Dallas, Texas  
**Program:** Deep Ellum neighborhood mural initiative

Installed in the heart of Deep Ellum’s arts district, *Texas Tantrum Trots and Pals* marked English’s return to Texas with one of the area’s most flamboyant pieces.  
Blending POPaganda characters with Texas-themed surrealism, the work immediately became a district landmark. Coverage from **D Magazine** and **StreetArtCities** highlights how the mural fits into Deep Ellum’s tradition of bold, maximalist walls and its broader revitalization as a contemporary public-art zone.
