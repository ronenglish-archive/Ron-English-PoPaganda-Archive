# 2019 – *Ronnie Rabbits Delusion* (K11 MUSEA, Hong Kong)

**Year:** 2019 (permanent installation)  
**Location:** Opera Theatre, K11 MUSEA, Hong Kong  
**Program:** K11 MUSEA Permanent Art Collection

Commissioned for Hong Kong’s K11 MUSEA during the Victoria Dockside redevelopment, this panoramic auditorium installation features Ron English’s Ronnie Rabbits and other Popaganda iconography across an expansive wall inside the Opera Theatre.  
The mall’s official art-program listings place English among a global roster of contemporary artists invited to create permanent works for the cultural-retail complex, reinforcing K11’s mission to merge commerce with museum-grade public art.
